# CopyPath: A program that helps you copy the relative or absolute paths of multiple files in a directory

## What is it?
For some reason, we may need to paste the paths of multiple files in a directory. For example, imagine you are adding some `lib` files into your Visual Studio project (No `link_libraries` in it, haha). Boring, right? Now you can copy and paste those paths in just a few clicks with CopyPath.

## How to use CopyPath?
Right click a directory (or the background of a directory), and then choose `Copy All Relavite Paths` or `Copy All Absolute Paths`. That's all.

## How to install CopyPath?
1. Download the released files [here]();
2. Run `install.bat` as an administrator.

Alternatively, you can compile it from the source code.
